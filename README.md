Liquibase: 
Why Use Liquibase?
Database Version Control: Liquibase allows you to track changes in your database schema over time, similar to version control for code.
Collaborative Development: When working in teams, Liquibase helps ensure that everyone's database schema stays in sync, avoiding conflicts.
Rollback Capabilities: You can easily roll back changes in case of issues.
Automation: Liquibase automatically manages schema updates when the application starts, ensuring consistency between your code and database.
