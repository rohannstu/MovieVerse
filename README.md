Why Liquibase here?

    Database Version Control:  Liquibase allows you to track changes in your database schema over time, similar to version control for code.
    Collaborative Development: When working in teams, Liquibase helps ensure that everyone's database schema stays in sync, avoiding conflicts.
    Rollback Capabilities:     You can easily roll back changes in case of issues.
    Automation:                Liquibase automatically manages schema updates when the application starts, ensuring consistency between your code and database.
